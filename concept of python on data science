A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity and higher level of code reuse for your application. Some functions are in built-in and some functions create according to own choice.

Built-in-function

Any function that is provided as part of a high-level language can be executed by a simple reference with the specification of the argument. Example(sum):


Import Numpy


import numpy as np
a=[1,3,5,7]
Summation


np.sum(a)
Products


np.prod(a)
Creating a function


def cube(x):
result = x*x*x
print(result)
Calling function


cube(5)
